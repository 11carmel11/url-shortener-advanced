# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./logo-main.png) Final 1 - URL shortener üìé

In this project you will create your own [URL shortener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening)!

This repository includes a basic template for starting the project:

## Instructions

- Fork this repository to your account as a **public** repo
- Clone your new repository to your computer üñ•
- Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` from the vscode terminal `ctrl + j` (make sure you are in the correct directory) üìÇ
- [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches) for the development process
- Make changes to the code to meet the project requirements üìù
- [Commit Early, Push Often](https://www.worklytics.co/commit-early-push-often/) - your work will be evaluated by your git flow and overall github usage üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Before submitting, create a pull request from the development branch into the main branch. **Leave the PR open and do not merge the branches**. The open PR will be used to review and mark your code
- Good Luck! ü§ò

## Guidelines

- Create a route `/api/shortUrl/` in your `express` app that will handle all url shortening requests. (We recommend using [express Router](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html))

- Write/read **Asynchronously** a single JSON file as your DB

- [Serve](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) your client files from your server at route `/`

- Style and change your front-end as you wish. You can take inspiration from this [example](https://www.shorturl.at/)

## Requirements

- Examine thoroughly and copy all functionality of [this](https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/) FCC example

- Use a `class DataBase{}` to read/write (**Asynchronously**) all data in your back-end (you can use a json file as persistent layer)

- Add another functionality to your service: a statistics route (`api/statistic/:shortUrl-id`) that will respond with the following data per `shortUrl-id`:

  - `creationDate` - a SQLDate format
  - `redirectCount` - the amount of times this url was used for redirection
  - `originalUrl`
  - `shortUrl-id`

## Bonus

- Add any feature you desire. Some ideas worth extra points:
  - Custom short URL. Support optional `shortUrl-id` parameter in your `POST` request. Pay attention to error handling.
  - Serve a styled statistics dashboard instead of the default JSON statistics
  - Use the [`jsonBin.io`](https://jsonbin.io/) service bin as your persistent layer in your back-end DB class (use CRUD operations to read write bins)
  - Try implementing user management

**Add an explanation in `README.md` for each bonus feature you add and a link to any resource you used**

## Grading policy

- Using jsonbin.io with/instead of writing to files
- Correct DB class usage
- Code quality and style: indentation, Meaningful and non-disambiguate variable names, Comments and documentation, file and directory structure
- Visual creativity, style your front-end to make it look awesome üíÖüèø
- Division to reusable functions, no code duplication
- Git usage: meaningful commit messages, small commits, folder and file structures, README file, issues, etc...

## Submitting

- Submit your solution repo link - an open PR from your dev branch to the main one
- Your readme should have a [`repl.it`](https://repl.it/) link with your solutions.
- Submit a link to your repo to the CRM.

GOOD LUCK!
